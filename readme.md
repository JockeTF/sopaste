# Sopaste

Rust port of Soder's Pastebin.


# Introduction

Soder's Pastebin was originally created by [Fredrik Soderlund] in 2007. The
original code runs on a now unsupported version of PHP, and its dependencies
have not been upgraded for quite some time. The pastebin is still under active
use despite this, so a gentle sunsetting is in order.

The goal of this project is to create a read-only version of Soder's Pastebin,
mimicking its original style and functionality. The plan is to go live as soon
as the minimal read-only features have been implemented. The creation of new
pastes will not be supported, at least not initially.
